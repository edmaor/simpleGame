DEVELOPING MY INTEFACE!!
I still have to desing how it will be distributed but I more or less know how to create a graphic interface.
So that's a really big step for me!
OMW already for building a DB and implementing it to the app.

Until now I've learned how to create & implement objects.
I'll try to self-learn how to build a DB to implement into the game,
  also how to make a graphic interface so it's easier to play.
